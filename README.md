# Topic for MA thesis

I offer the supervision of a well-defined computational study that is described below in detail. The study aims to answer a scientifically relevant question.


## The family size effect

A word's family size is defined as "the type count of all the complex words in which this word appears as a constituent" (Schreuder & Baayen, 1997). For instance, the Dutch word 'vogel' (*bird*) occurs in various other words, such as, among others, 'vogelen' (*to bird*), 'vogelaar' (*birder*), or 'uitvogelen' (*to find out*). The greater a word's family size, the faster the word will be recognized in **visual** word recognition. A facilitative family size effect was also obtaines for irregular past participles (De Jong, Schreuder & Baayen, 2000). For instance, 'vochten' (*fought*) activates the family of 'vechten' (*to fight*), but not that of 'vocht' (*moisture*). As irregular past participles' stems formaly deviate from the citation forms' stems, the family size effect cannot be explained by the means of formal similarities between the family members, which is why the effect is assumed to have a semantic nature. 

Recent research suggests that family size facilitates word recognition not only in visual, but also in **auditory** word recognition (e.g. Winther-Balling & Baayen, 2012). Whether family size influences response times of irregular past participles in **auditory** word recognition, will be the MA thesis' research question and shed light on the family size's driving forces in the auditory modality.


## Modelling approach

The MA student will build a computational model (e.g. liner mixed-effects model) that predicts response times to irregular past participles from the Biggest Auditory Lexical Decision Task Yet (Ernestus & Cutler, 2015). The response times will be provided, thus data collection will not be part of the MA thesis. Rather, the MA student will investigate how the inclusion of the predictor family size influences the accuracy, with which the model predicts the response times. To rule out that the effect emerges from other word's properties, the MA student will determine the most important predictors that in the past have been shown to influence auditory lexical decision latencies and include them in the model (co-variates).


## Requirements

The MA student knows linear mixed-effects models and how to implement them. Successful completion of a course on speech processing or the theory of speech will be advantageous, but is not obligatory. Speaking Dutch fluently also will be advantageous, but is not required.


## Learning Goals

After completion of the MA thesis,

1. the MA student will be able to make sensible decisions in the context of computational modelling
2. the MA student will know how to fit and interpret linear mixed-effects models
3. the MA student will have a good knowledge of the theory about human auditory word recognition

This skill set qualifies for an academic career or for a career in the private sector as data analyst or investigator, among others.
