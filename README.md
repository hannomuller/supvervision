# Topic for MA thesis

I offer the supervision of a well-defined computational study that is described below in detail. The study aims to answer a scientifically relevant question.


## Theory

A word's family size is defined as the type count of all words that include the word as a component. For instance, the Dutch word 'vogel' (*bird*) occurs in various other words, such as, among others, 'vogelen' (*to bird*), 'vogelaar' (*birder*), or 'uitvogelen' (*to find out*). The greater a word's family size, the faster the word will be recognized in **visual** word recognition. This also holds for irregular past participles, in which the stem is differently realized than in the word's citation form. For instance, both 'denk' (*I think*) and its past participle 'dacht' (*I/you/he/she thought*) belong to the same family, but the stem surfaces as its citation form only in 'denk'. As the family size effect for irregular past participles cannot be explained by the means of formal similarities between the target word and its family members, the effect is assumed to have a semantic nature. 

Recent research suggests that family size facilitates word recognition not only in visual, but also in **auditory** word recognition. Whether family size influences response times of irregular past participles in **auditory** word recognition, will be the he MA thesis' research question and shed light of the family size's driving forces in the auditory modality.


## Method

The MA student will build a computational model (e.g. liner mixed-effects model) that predicts response times to irregular past participles from an auditory lexical decision task. The response times will be provided, thus data collection will not be part of the MA thesis. Rather, the MA student will investigate how the inclusion of the predictor family size influences the accuracy, with which the model predicts the response times. To rule out that the effect emerges from other word's properties, the MA student will determine the most important predictors that in the past have been shown to influence auditory lexical decision latencies and include them in the model (co-variates).


## Requirements

The MA student knows linear mixed-effects models and how to implement them. Successful completion of a course on speech processing or the theory of speech will be advantageous, but is not obligatory. Speaking Dutch fluently also will be advantageous, but is not required.


## Learning Goals

After completion of the MA thesis,

1. the MA student will be able to make sensible decisions in the context of computational modelling
2. the MA student will know how to fit and interpret linear mixed-effects models
3. the MA student will have a good knowledge of the theory about human auditory word recognition

This skill set qualifies for an academic career or for a career in the private sector as data analyst or investigator, among others.
