# Topic for MA thesis

Abstract

The MA student will build a computational model (e.g. liner mixed-effects model) that predicts response latencies from an auditory lexical decision task. The response latencies will be provided, thus data collection will not be part of the MA thesis. Rather, the MA student will investigate how the inclusion of a theoretically relevant predictor influences the accuracy, with which the model predicts the response latencies. The predictor under investigation will capture information that are related to a word's morphological structure, so that conclusions can be drawn about the role of morphology in auditory word recognition. I will guide the MA student to derive a concrete research question that can be answered in the context of an MA thesis, to build a valid computational model, to utilize this model for answering a theoretical question, and to discuss the findings in light of the literature.
